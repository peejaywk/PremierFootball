# Premier Football

Premier Football is a website for football fans who want to keep track of their favourite Premiership football team. The website utilises the [API-FOOTBALL](https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-football)

* Display the current league standings.
* Display live scores if any games are being played.
* A stretch objective of using Google Maps to display the location of the stadium.
